This project is a compulsory project from the lists of available research topics given to the students enrolled in PHYS3900. I have chosen this topic for my research

Status: completed

note: uploading a completed project so it serves as a backup

=================

Workflow

1) Creating a masterfile
- accessing data gathered through the f606w and f814w filters, and the proper motion catalog
- filtering bad data and using only bright stars
- good data stored in masterfile

2) Creating a velocity dispersion profile (VDP) of the bright stars
- sorting stars into bins by distance

3) Calculation corrections
- Uncertainties
- km/s to mas/yr

4) Repeat steps 1-3 but for faint stars
- Plot faint stars VDP with bright stars VDP

5) Create masterfile for model (generated by sv)
- remove unused values
- this is a model for NGC2808 containing no IMBH
- aim is to check the VDP of the stars and no of stars at certain vel. are the same as the model (if same, then no IMBH)

6) Repeat 5) for 1% and 5% IMBH

7) Compare which model matches with the data the most
- perform Kolmogorov-Smirnov (ks) test
