Workflow

1) Creating a masterfile
- accessing data gathered through the f606w and f814w filters, and the proper motion catalog
- filtering bad data
- good data stored in masterfile

2) Creating a velocity dispersion profile
- sorting stars into bins by distance

3) Uncertainty calculation

4) Repeat steps 1-3 but for faint stars

5) Create masterfile for model
